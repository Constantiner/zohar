# miko

A functional type-safe event emitter library with zero dependencies

Miko (巫女) refers to a traditional shrine maiden in Japanese Shinto religion who serves as an intermediary between the gods and people, delivering divine messages. Similarly, the `miko` library acts as a conduit between events and subscribers, efficiently transmitting events to listeners and ensuring seamless, type-safe communication.
